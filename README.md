# GUIDE – Installation and Use

This guide explains how to install the extension either by using the folder directly or by running the installer. Follow the method that suits you best.

## Installing with the folder only
1. Locate the folder named **com.ExcaliburFx**.  
2. Copy the entire folder without renaming it.

### Windows
Paste it into:
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Common Files\Adobe\CEP\Extensions\`

If the **CEP** or **Extensions** folders do not exist, create them manually.

### macOS
Paste it into:
`/Library/Application Support/Adobe/CEP/extensions/`

If you do not see the **CEP** or **extensions** folders, you may create them as needed.  
You might need administrator rights to access or modify these locations.

Once copied, restart your Adobe application so it can detect the extension.

## Installing with the .exe
1. Double-click the `.exe` installer.  
2. Wait for the setup window to appear.  
3. Follow each step on the screen (installation path, confirmation, permissions).  
4. When finished, restart your Adobe application to load the extension properly.

Both installation methods lead to the same result. Choose the one that feels easiest for you.
