# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in ExcaliburFX, please report it responsibly by contacting us directly.  

Do **not** open a public issue for security problems.  

## Notes on OS Warnings

ExcaliburFX interacts with After Effects via scripts.  
As a result, some operating systems (Windows Defender, SmartScreen, macOS Gatekeeper, etc.) may **flag the extension as potentially unsafe**.  
This is a **false positive** and does not indicate malicious behavior. The extension is safe if downloaded from the official repository.  
No data is collected, nothing is hidden, and everything is fully transparent and verifiable by the user.

## Response

- Reports will be acknowledged within 48 hours.  
- We will investigate the issue and provide updates until it is resolved.  
- A fix will be released as soon as possible.  

## Supported Versions

Please indicate the version of ExcaliburFX you are using when reporting security issues.
